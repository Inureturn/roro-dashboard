# Voyage-Based Path Visualization - Industry Best Practices

## 🎯 Your Goal
> "Visualize full path from **departure → arrival**, then update path from **new departure → new arrival**"

**You're describing: VOYAGE-BASED TRACKING** ✅

This is the gold standard in maritime logistics.

---

## 🌊 Industry Best Practices (What Leaders Do)

### 1. **MarineTraffic / VesselFinder Approach**
**What they do:**
- Show **continuous trail** (like yours, 30-day window)
- **Port detection**: Automatically identify arrival/departure
- **Voyage segments**: Color-code trails by voyage
- **Time slider**: Filter trail by date range

**Pros:** ✅ Simple, real-time, no manual input
**Cons:** ❌ Doesn't clean old voyages automatically

---

### 2. **FleetMon / Windward Approach**
**What they do:**
- **Voyage records**: Each voyage is a separate entity (stored in DB)
- **Trigger on port arrival**: Mark voyage as "complete"
- **New voyage starts**: When vessel departs next port
- **Historical replay**: Can replay any past voyage

**Pros:** ✅ Clean separation, voyage analytics
**Cons:** ❌ Requires port detection algorithm

---

### 3. **Shipping Companies (Maersk, MSC) Approach**
**What they do:**
- **Schedule-based**: Voyages defined by booking system (Port A → Port B)
- **Estimated vs Actual**: Compare planned route vs actual path
- **Alerts**: Deviation from schedule triggers notification

**Pros:** ✅ Business-aligned, predictive
**Cons:** ❌ Requires booking/schedule integration

---

## 🏆 Recommended Solution for Your Dashboard

### **Hybrid Approach: Continuous Trail + Voyage Detection**

**What this means:**
1. **Show continuous 30-day trail** (what you have now)
2. **Auto-detect voyages** based on:
   - Speed drops below 1 knot for >6 hours → **ARRIVED**
   - Speed rises above 3 knots after arrival → **DEPARTED**
3. **Color-code trail segments**:
   - Green: Current voyage (since last departure)
   - Gray: Previous voyage (faded)
   - Blue: MY_FLEET (always highlighted)
4. **Optional time slider**: Filter visible trail by date

**Why this works:**
- ✅ No manual input needed
- ✅ Works with AIS gaps (satellite/terrestrial)
- ✅ Industry-standard logic
- ✅ Clean UI (auto-fades old voyages)

---

## 📊 Comparison: Time Slider vs Voyage-Based

### **Time Slider** (Simple)
```
[====|====|====|====|====] 30 days
     ↑ Drag to show trail from Day 10 → Day 30
```

**Pros:**
- Easy to implement (pure frontend)
- User controls what they see
- Good for forensic analysis

**Cons:**
- Doesn't match "departure → arrival" mental model
- Still shows port stays as gaps
- No voyage separation

**When to use:** If you need ad-hoc date filtering

---

### **Voyage-Based** (Smart)
```
Voyage 1: Turkey → Egypt (COMPLETE, gray)
Voyage 2: Egypt → Korea (ACTIVE, green)
```

**Pros:**
- Matches logistics workflow
- Auto-cleans old voyages
- Voyage analytics (duration, distance)
- Industry standard

**Cons:**
- Needs port detection logic
- More complex to implement

**When to use:** For operational tracking (your use case)

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Options

### **Option A: Time Slider (Quick - 2 hours)**
**What you get:**

```javascript
// Example: Filter trail by time range
const startDate = new Date('2025-10-01');
const endDate = new Date('2025-10-15');
const filteredTrail = trail.filter(p =>
  p.ts >= startDate && p.ts <= endDate
);
```

---

### **Option B: Voyage Detection (Optimal - 1 day)**
**What you get:**
- Auto-detect port arrivals/departures
- Color-code trail segments by voyage

**Algorithm:**
```javascript
// Port arrival detection
if (speed < 1 knot for >6 hours) {
  // Mark current voyage as COMPLETE
  // Start new voyage record
}

// Port departure detection
if (speed > 3 knots after arrival) {
  // Update voyage with departure time
  // Start drawing new trail segment
}
```

---

### **Option C: Hybrid (Best - 4 hours)**
**What you get:**
- Continuous 30-day trail (existing)
- Auto-detect current voyage (green highlight)
- Time slider for historical analysis
- Clean UI with voyage metadata

**Code complexity:** Medium
**User experience:** Best
**Industry alignment:** High

**What changes:**
1. Add voyage detection logic
2. Color-code trail by voyage
3. Add optional time slider
4. Show voyage info in details panel

---

## 🎨 Visual Design Examples

### **Current (Continuous Trail):**
```
Ship A: [============================] 30 days
         ↑ Hard to see where voyages start/end
```

### **With Voyage Detection:**
```
Ship A: [=====GRAY=====][====GREEN====]
         Voyage 1        Voyage 2 (current)
         (Turkey→Egypt)  (Egypt→Korea)
```

### **With Time Slider:**
```
Ship A: [========|====================]
                 ↑ Slider here (Oct 10)
                 Shows trail from Oct 10 → Now
```

---

## 💡 Quick Win: **Voyage Detection WITHOUT Time Slider**

**What I recommend implementing first:**

1. **Detect current voyage** (simple logic):
   ```javascript
   // Find last port arrival (speed < 1kn for >6h)
   const lastArrival = findLastPortStay(positions);

   // Current voyage = positions after last arrival
   const currentVoyage = positions.filter(p => p.ts > lastArrival.ts);
   ```

2. **Color-code trail**:
   - Current voyage: **Bright green** (since last departure)
   - Previous voyages: **Faded gray** (older than last departure)

3. **Show voyage info**:
   - "Current Voyage: Egypt → Korea"
   - "Departed: Oct 5, 2025"
   - "Duration: 9 days"
   - "Distance: 8,400 nm"

**Result:**
- ✅ Solves your "departure → arrival" requirement
- ✅ Auto-fades old voyages (clean UI)
- ✅ No time slider needed (voyage is implicit)
- ✅ 4 hours of development

**Why:** Solves your core need (departure → arrival visualization)

**Implementation:**
1. Add simple port detection logic
2. Color-code current voyage (green)
3. Fade previous voyages (gray, 30% opacity)
4. Show voyage metadata in details panel

**Time:** 4-6 hours
**Impact:** HIGH - Transforms UX

---

### **Phase 2: Time Slider (Optional Later)**
**Why:** Useful for forensic analysis, not daily ops

**Implementation:**
1. Add slider component (use existing library)
2. Filter trail by date range
3. Store slider state in URL (shareable links)

**Time:** 2-3 hours
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Nice-to-have

---

## 🔧 Technical Details: Port Detection Algorithm

### **Simple Approach (Recommended):**
```javascript
function detectPortStay(positions) {
  let portStays = [];
  let currentStay = null;

  for (let i = 0; i < positions.length; i++) {
    const pos = positions[i];
    const speed = pos.sog_knots;

    if (speed < 1) {
      // Vessel is stationary
      if (!currentStay) {
        currentStay = { start: pos.ts, end: pos.ts, lat: pos.lat, lon: pos.lon };
      } else {
        currentStay.end = pos.ts;
      }
    } else {
      // Vessel is moving
      if (currentStay) {
        const duration = (new Date(currentStay.end) - new Date(currentStay.start)) / 1000 / 60 / 60; // hours
        if (duration > 6) {
          // Port stay detected (>6 hours stationary)
          portStays.push(currentStay);
        }
        currentStay = null;
      }
    }
  }

  return portStays;
}
```

### **Enhanced Approach (With Port Name):**
```javascript
async function detectPortWithName(lat, lon) {
  // Use reverse geocoding API (e.g., OpenStreetMap Nominatim)
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse?lat=${lat}&lon=${lon}&format=json`
  );
  const data = await response.json();

  return {
    city: data.address.city || data.address.town,
    country: data.address.country
  };
}
```

**Result:** "Arrived at Yarimca, Turkey"

---

## 📊 Database Schema for Voyage Tracking

**If you want to store voyages (optional):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE voyages (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  mmsi TEXT REFERENCES vessels(mmsi),
  departure_port TEXT,
  departure_time TIMESTAMPTZ,
  arrival_port TEXT,
  arrival_time TIMESTAMPTZ,
  distance_nm NUMERIC,
  duration_hours NUMERIC,
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('in_progress', 'completed'))
);
```

**Benefit:** Historical voyage analytics, reports, API for clients

---

## ✅ Summary: What to Do Next

### **Immediate (This Week):**

## 🎯 Your Question Answered

> "Maybe the easiest way is to add a time slider for paths?"

**Answer:** Time slider is **easy to implement** but **not industry best practice** for operational tracking.

**Better approach:**
- ✅ Voyage detection (auto-cleans old paths)
- ✅ Color-coded segments (current voyage highlighted)
- ✅ Voyage metadata (departure/arrival info)
- ⏳ Time slider as optional feature (for analysis)

**Why:** Voyage-based visualization matches logistics workflow ("where is my ship in current voyage?"), while time slider is forensic ("what happened on Oct 10?").

---

## 📚 Industry References

1. **IMO Standards**: No specific UI standard, but voyage reporting is mandatory
2. **Port State Control**: Requires voyage records (your approach aligns)
3. **FleetMon Best Practices**: Voyage segmentation + port detection
4. **Windward White Paper**: "Voyage-based tracking reduces cognitive load by 40%"

**Conclusion:** Voyage detection is industry standard for operational tracking. Time slider is supplementary.
