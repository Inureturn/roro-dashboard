## How to Monitor Each Service

### 1. AWS Lightsail ($5/mo - FIXED)

**Check usage:**
1. Go to https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/
2. Click your instance (Seoul)
3. View "Metrics" tab

**What to watch:**
- Network transfer: Should stay under 1TB/month
- CPU usage: Should be <20% (ingestor is lightweight)

**Current usage (14 vessels):**
- AIS WebSocket: ~10 MB/day = 300 MB/month
- Supabase writes: ~1 MB/day = 30 MB/month
- **Total: ~330 MB/month (well under 1TB limit)**

**Will it ever exceed $5?**
- No! Fixed price, unlimited compute
- Only risk: If you exceed 1TB transfer (very unlikely)

**To reduce (if needed):**
- Downgrade to $3.50/month plan (512MB RAM)

---

### 2. Supabase (FREE - Has Limits)

**Check usage:**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Click your project
3. View "Settings" → "Usage"

**Critical limits:**
| Metric | Free Tier Limit | Your Usage (14 vessels) | Status |
|--------|----------------|-------------------------|---------|
| **Database Size** | 500 MB | ~50 MB (with cleanup) | ✅ 10% |
| **Bandwidth** | 2 GB/month | ~200 MB/month | ✅ 10% |
| **Realtime Connections** | 200 concurrent | <10 typically | ✅ 5% |

**How we stay under limits:**

**Database Size (500MB limit):**
- Without cleanup: 2GB/year → exceeds limit in 3 months ❌
- **With 90-day cleanup: ~150MB max** ✅
- Cron job deletes old data daily

**Bandwidth (2GB/month limit):**
- Dashboard loads: ~500KB per session
- Realtime updates: ~1KB per position
- **Estimated: 200-300MB/month for 100 users/day** ✅

**Monitor with SQL:**
```sql
-- Check database size
SELECT
  pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('postgres')) as total_size,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('vessel_positions')) as positions_size;

-- Check row count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vessel_positions;
-- Should be <700k with 90-day cleanup
```

**Alert levels:**
- 🟢 <250 MB = Safe
- 🟡 250-400 MB = Monitor
- 🔴 >400 MB = Run cleanup manually
- ⛔ >500 MB = Upgrade to Pro ($25/mo)

**To reduce costs:**
1. Run cleanup.mjs weekly (currently daily)
2. Reduce FLEET_MMSIS to fewer vessels
3. Increase rate limit to 200m/300s

---

### 3. MapTiler (FREE - 100k loads/month)

**Check usage:**
1. Go to https://cloud.maptiler.com/
2. View "Statistics" tab

**What counts as a "load"?**
- 1 page view = 1 load
- Zooming/panning = 0 additional loads (tiles cached)

**Your usage:**
- 100 users/day × 30 days = 3,000 loads/month
- **3% of free limit** ✅

**Will you exceed?**
- Only if you get 3,000+ users/day (unlikely!)
- Upgrade to $29/mo for 1 million loads if needed

**To reduce:**
- Enable browser caching (already done)
- Use embed widget (fewer loads)

---

### 4. AISStream (FREE - 14 vessels)

**Check usage:**
1. Go to https://aisstream.io/account
2. View "Usage" tab

**Free tier limits:**
- 100 messages/second (you use ~0.1/sec) ✅
- Unlimited vessels (you track 14) ✅
- 2 BBOX regions (you use 2: Korea + Med) ✅

**Your usage:**
- 14 vessels × ~3 updates/minute = 42 messages/minute
- **0.7 messages/second (well under 100 limit)** ✅

**Will you exceed?**
- Only if you add 1,000+ vessels (not realistic)

---

## Total Cost Guarantee

**Current setup (14 vessels, 100 users/day):**
```
AWS Lightsail:  $5.00  (fixed)
Supabase:       $0.00  (10% of limits)
MapTiler:       $0.00  (3% of limits)
AISStream:      $0.00  (1% of limits)
─────────────────────
TOTAL:          $5.00/month ✅
```

**At scale (100 vessels, 1000 users/day):**
```
AWS Lightsail:  $10.00  (upgrade to 2GB RAM)
Supabase:       $25.00  (Pro tier for bandwidth)
MapTiler:       $0.00   (still under 100k)
AISStream:      $0.00   (still under limits)
─────────────────────
TOTAL:          $35.00/month
```

**To stay under $10/month forever:**
1. ✅ Keep Lightsail at $5 (current)
2. ✅ Run 90-day cleanup daily (keeps Supabase free)
3. ✅ Keep users <3,000/day (keeps MapTiler free)
4. ✅ Keep vessels <50 (keeps AISStream free)

**Current margins:**
- Database: 90% headroom
- Bandwidth: 90% headroom
- Map loads: 97% headroom
- Messages: 99% headroom

**You're extremely safe!** 🎉

## Automated Monitoring

### Set Up Alerts

**Supabase (via SQL):**
Create a weekly check:
```sql
-- Run this weekly, get email if >400MB
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN pg_database_size('postgres') > 400 * 1024 * 1024
    THEN 'WARNING: Database exceeds 400MB'
    ELSE 'OK'
  END as status,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('postgres')) as size;
```

**Cron job logs:**
Check cleanup is running:
```bash
# Add to your weekly routine
tail /tmp/roro-cleanup.log
# Should show recent deletions
```

---

## Quick Health Check Commands

**Weekly checklist (2 minutes):**

```bash
# 1. Check VPS is running
ssh ubuntu@43.200.220.234 "pm2 status"

# 2. Check database size
# (Run in Supabase SQL Editor)
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('postgres'));

# 3. Check position count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vessel_positions;
# Should be <700k

# 4. Check cleanup logs
ssh ubuntu@43.200.220.234 "tail -20 /tmp/roro-cleanup.log"
```

**If anything looks wrong:**
1. Database >400MB? Run `node cleanup.mjs`
2. PM2 stopped? Run `pm2 restart roro-ingestor`
3. No recent logs? Check `crontab -l`

---

## When to Upgrade (Optional)

**Upgrade Lightsail to $10/mo if:**
- Tracking >50 vessels
- Ingestor CPU >80% consistently

**Upgrade Supabase to $25/mo if:**
- Database >500MB (more vessels/history)
- Users >5,000/day (bandwidth limit)
- Need phone support

**Upgrade MapTiler to $29/mo if:**
- Users >3,000/day (map loads)

**Current verdict: No upgrades needed for years!** ✅

---

## Cost Per Vessel

**Current (14 vessels):**
- $5 ÷ 14 = **$0.36 per vessel per month**

**At 50 vessels (still free tier):**
- $5 ÷ 50 = **$0.10 per vessel per month**

**At 100 vessels (need Supabase Pro):**
- $35 ÷ 100 = **$0.35 per vessel per month**

**Comparison to competitors:**
- MarineTraffic Pro: $50/month for 10 vessels ($5/vessel) ❌
- VesselFinder: $30/month for 5 vessels ($6/vessel) ❌
- **Your system: $0.36/vessel** ✅ 94% cheaper!

---

## Summary

✅ **Currently spending: $5/month**
✅ **Margin of safety: 90%+ on all limits**
✅ **Will NOT exceed $5 with current setup**
✅ **Monitoring: Check Supabase dashboard weekly**
✅ **Automated cleanup prevents overages**

**You're locked in at $5/month!** 🎉
