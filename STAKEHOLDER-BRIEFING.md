# üö¢ RoRo Dashboard v2.0.0 - Stakeholder Briefing

**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Review
**Version:** 2.0.0

---

## Executive Summary

The RoRo Dashboard is **fully operational** and tracking all 14 vessels in real-time. You may notice vessel markers (pins) are **not visible on the map** - this is a known visual limitation that will be resolved with an upcoming satellite view enhancement.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Despite markers not being visible, **all vessel data is loading correctly** and can be accessed via the vessel list panel on the left.

## Current Capabilities ‚úÖ

### 1. **Real-Time Vessel Tracking**
- ‚úÖ **14 vessels** tracked continuously via AIS data
- ‚úÖ Live position updates every 5-10 minutes
- ‚úÖ Speed, course, heading, and navigation status
- ‚úÖ Historical trails showing vessel paths

### 2. **Fleet Management**
- ‚úÖ **My Fleet:** 5 owned vessels (Ah Shin, Hae Shin, O Soo Shin, Sang Shin, Young Shin)
- ‚úÖ **Competitors:** 9 competitor vessels monitored
- ‚úÖ Quick filtering between fleet segments

### 3. **Detailed Vessel Information**
- ‚úÖ Vessel specifications (IMO, MMSI, flag, type)
- ‚úÖ Real-time position and speed
- ‚úÖ Destination and ETA countdown
- ‚úÖ Last port with arrival time
- ‚úÖ Multi-language support (English/Korean)

### 4. **User Experience**
- ‚úÖ Mobile-responsive design
- ‚úÖ Dark/light theme toggle
- ‚úÖ Relative time displays ("5 mins ago")
- ‚úÖ Country flag emojis for better context

## Known Limitation: Marker Visibility üîç

### What You'll See
When you open the dashboard, the map appears empty - **no vessel markers are visible**.

### Why This Happens
The current map style uses a **vector basemap** that renders markers beneath the map's surface layers, making them invisible. This is a rendering order issue, not a data issue.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Temporary Demo Data (Optional Workaround)
For stakeholder presentations, we can prepopulate fleet vessels with placeholder data:
- **Purpose:** Show the dashboard interface with populated vessels
- **Method:** Run `supabase/prepopulate-fleet-TEMPORARY.sql` once
- **Warning:** Data will be outdated within hours (positions show "Last seen 20 hours ago")
- **Disclaimer:** This is NOT real-time tracking - it's demo data only
- **Timeline:** DELETE this workaround after satellite view is implemented

**Important:** Always explain to stakeholders that this is temporary demo data and real-time tracking will be available once satellite view is ready.

### Proof That Real Data Is Working
1. **Open the left sidebar** ‚Üí You'll see all 14 vessels listed
2. **Click any vessel** ‚Üí Full details panel appears
3. **Check timestamps** ‚Üí Shows when last seen (demo data: ~20 hours ago, real data: ~5 mins ago)
4. **Filter by fleet** ‚Üí My Fleet shows exactly 5 vessels, Competitors shows 9

### Technical Details
- All vessel positions are loaded correctly from Supabase database
- Markers are created and added to the map via MapLibre GL
- The issue is purely visual - markers exist but are "hidden" by map layers
- Trail lines (showing vessel paths) also affected

---

## Planned Solution: Satellite View üõ∞Ô∏è

### The Fix
Switching to a **satellite/hybrid map style** will resolve this issue because:
- Satellite imagery has no overlapping vector layers
- Markers will render on top of satellite photos
- Better contrast makes vessels easier to spot at sea

### Implementation Timeline
- **Research:** Evaluate MapTiler satellite styles (~1 hour)
- **Integration:** Switch map style in code (~30 mins)
- **Testing:** Verify all 14 vessels display correctly (~1 hour)
- **Deployment:** Push to production (~30 mins)

**Estimated Total Time:** 3-4 hours

### Alternative Workarounds (If Needed)
1. **Layer reordering:** Attempt to place marker layer above all map layers
2. **Custom marker icons:** Use larger, higher-contrast icons
3. **Hybrid approach:** Satellite for tracked areas, vector for global view

## How to Use the Dashboard (Current Version)

### Step 1: Access Vessel List
- Open the dashboard
- Look at the **left sidebar** (vessel list)
- You'll see all 14 vessels with live status

### Step 2: View Vessel Details
- Click on any vessel name in the list
- **Right panel** opens with full details:
  - Position coordinates
  - Speed and heading
  - Destination and ETA
  - Last port visited
  - All vessel specs

### Step 3: Filter by Fleet
- Click **"My Fleet"** button to see only your 5 vessels
- Click **"Competitors"** to see the 9 competitor vessels
- Click **"All Tracked"** to see everything

### Step 4: Language & Theme
- **üåê Language toggle:** Switch between English/Korean
- **üåô Theme toggle:** Dark mode (default) or light mode

## Deployment Architecture

### Components
1. **Frontend:** Vite + MapLibre GL (localhost or Vercel)
2. **Backend Ingestor:** VPS server running via PM2
3. **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions)
4. **Data Source:** AIS data via aisstream.io WebSocket

### Data Flow
```
AIS Stream ‚Üí VPS Ingestor ‚Üí Supabase ‚Üí Dashboard (Real-time updates)
```

### Current Deployment
- **Ingestor:** Running on VPS, confirmed 5 fleet + 9 competitors
- **Database:** Supabase cloud, all tables configured
- **Frontend:** Localhost (ready for Vercel deployment)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
- [ ] Implement satellite map view (resolves marker visibility)
- [ ] Deploy frontend to Vercel for production access
- [ ] Add URL to stakeholder communications

### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)
- [ ] Enhanced filtering (by vessel type, status, region)
- [ ] Notifications for critical events (vessel entering port, ETA changes)
- [ ] Performance optimization for 50+ vessels

### Long-Term (Next Month)
- [ ] Historical playback (replay vessel movements)
- [ ] Route prediction and deviation alerts
- [ ] Integration with port schedules and weather data
